# Number-To-Words-Python

This is a program created by me in which any number with digits less than 12 can be expressed in words.

Open up your terminal in the folder that contains app.py file.

type <kbd>python app.py</kbd> (Make sure Python is installed before running the program)

Enter any number less than 12 digits and it will give that number in words.
